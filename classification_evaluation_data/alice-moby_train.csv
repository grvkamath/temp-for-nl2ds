quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the
one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,
Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour
the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to
the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,
noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though
among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum
was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness
typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and
contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine
spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white
forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek
mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white
bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of
the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their
theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest
envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of
their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for
white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and
though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially
employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the
Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the
four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for
all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul
than that redness which affrights in blood.",Moby Dick,5,0,0,0,0,4,1,20,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,17,0,3,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,30,0,1,1,3,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,56,4,0,0,2,1,1,5,12,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was

wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of
her little sister's dream.",Alice,1,0,1,0,2,1,0,7,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.",Alice,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,20,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.",Alice,3,1,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0
