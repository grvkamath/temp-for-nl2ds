need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me\n\n\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning\nMy eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade\nMy eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning\n\nNow where I come from burning weed it is a habit\nA big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it\nCause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic\nCause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit\nYup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood\nOne of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should\nOne of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good\nBurning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel\nBut me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug\nAnd if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug\nWhere I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged\nWhere I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub\nWhere I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine\nI blaze high grade weed all the time!\n\nNow my eyes are red\nCause you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nAnd you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, I don't need you\n\n\nWoooah\nWoooah\nWoooah\nYea\n\nCause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right\nI won't stop until my name's in lights\nWith stadium heights, with Damian Rice\nOn red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights\nBecause I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer\/songwriter, yeah\nThe game's over but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows but\nI haven't got a house plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow, from day one I've been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nNow I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause it's another day\n\nRucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows\nI'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know\nOn tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant\nIf you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate\nMy flows developing, skin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nDo it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image\nPut in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorld's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\nI'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing\nI'm back to sing this\n\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man\n\nI'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic\nAnd I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rapper shoes using new laces\nI'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the mustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio\nMelody music maker, reading all the papers\nThey say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator\n\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me man\nDon't need yu\n\nCool\u2026"}

The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.\n\nThey say, \"They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone\"\nSo on that note, I'm leavin' after this song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay \u2013 so long!\nBut at least let me tell you why I'm this way \u2013 hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves\nWho made love under the sycamore tree\nWhich makes me a more sicker MC\nAnd my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain\nAlthough, through the years I gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here\nShe knows my purpose was on purpose; I ain't perfect, I care\nBut I feel worthless, 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear\nNow I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted\nBut I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\n\nShawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is \u2013\u00a0at 4, he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.\n\nNow, all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me\nSo, with that disdain in my membrane\nGot on my pimp game; \"Fuck the world,\" my defense came\nThen DeHaven introduced me to the game\nSpanish Jos\u00e9 introduced me to 'caine \u2013\u00a0I'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd\nAnd all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now\nMy self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag\nGot a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus, I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had\nSupposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass\nI'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap\nBut that came second to me movin' this crack\n\"Gimme a second, I swear,\" I would say about my rap career\n'Til '96 came, \"niggas \u2013\u00a0I'm here\"; goodbye!\n\nShawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.\n\nGoodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush\nYour blood boils, you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush\nAnd you in a drop, you're so easy to touch\nNo two days are alike except the 1st and 15th, pretty much\nAnd \"trust\" is a word you seldom hear from us\nHustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up\nAnd the drought will define a man when the well dries up\nYou learn the worth of water \u2013 without work, you thirst 'til you die \u2013 yup!\nAnd niggas get tied up for product\nAnd little brothers' ring fingers get cut up\nTo show mothers they really got 'em\nAnd this was the stress I lived with\n'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven\nFor every bad decision I made, every sister I played\n'Cause I'm still paranoid to this day\nAnd it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made\nThis is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me\n\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nNow if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade..."}

Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. \u2014 The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. \u2014 I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'\"\n\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nYour silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free\nWhat I got for me, it is for me\nWhat we made, we made to set us free"}

Or a voice filled with passion?\nTo my real hip-hop heads, please stand up\nCause the only people that can preserve this art is us"}
